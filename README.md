A very talkative REST automation and testing tool for developers


## TODO:

* Introduce (Overstated)[https://github.com/fabiospampinato/overstated] for requests and templates.

* Body JSON view to show request JSON which has references to template objects.
  * References need to be shown with a special icon. Clicking the icon opens a variable editor.
  * Template values can be filled by pointing them to environment variables of by supplying the value directly.
