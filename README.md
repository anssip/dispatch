# Dispatch

A tool for REST API design, and for request testing and management. This is a tool similar to Postman, Insomnia and Paw, but better geared towards developers. It supports templates for request bodies and these templates can be used as building blocks in the requests. It will include a strong Git/GitHub integration making it easy for teams to share the Dispatch projects.


## Status

Dispatch is under development at the monent and is not ready for real use yet.
